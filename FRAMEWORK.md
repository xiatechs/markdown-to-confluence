# markdown-to-confluence methodology:

```
1) markdown files must be within same folder as the code that they are talking about

2) any images in the markdown must be saved in the same folder as the markdown files

3) if you want to use those images in the markdown file, it must be linked locally i.e:
	![Diagram](diagram.png)
  
4) you can have as many markdown files as you want in one folder, but typically
it should just be one for each package.
```
