# INDEX readme

here i am testing out using relative local links in github to product
confluence absolute links - as if by magic.

[lower level relative link](./file/downhere/hello.md)

[node markdown folder](../readme.md)

using fuzzy logic the links above to re-jigged to align with their correct source.
it's not 100% foolproof but hey it's better than nothing, right?
