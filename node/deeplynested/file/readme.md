# INDEX readme

here i am testing out using relative local links in github to product
confluence absolute links - as if by magic.

[lower level relative link](downhere/hello.md)

[test markdown folder](../testfolder/testmarkdown.md)

[markdown](../../markdown-to-confluence/markdown/readme.md)

[node](../../markdown-to-confluence/readme.md)

using fuzzy logic the links above to re-jigged to align with their correct source.
it's not 100% foolproof but hey it's better than nothing, right?
